                Zoya Maverick has been a musical artist for about 5 years. Making a range of music from pop to rnb even into rap. She spent about 3 years really enganged in writing love and break up songs 
                sharing her experiances and expresions with the poeple she cared about. She found herself wrapped up in what she describe as "in
                dustry behavoir". Although feeling very frustrated with the scene, and the expectations she tried to perservere.
                But Life had other ideas for the Songtress. In 2021 the world as she knew it came crashing down in the unfortunate event of witnessing the enexpected death of another by the hands of a friend. The traumatic event
                changed her view of the world and the way she interacted with it jurastically. She struggled with extreme anxiety and felt as if her spirit was being attacked. Falling into a deep depression
                she didnt know where to turn. She found it expremely hard to create in an authentic way because of her fears. Relizing this she cried out for help to the last person expected. Really the last person contact on her List.
                God.
            </p>
            <p class="indent">Her testimony brought her to the realization, of course, she could no longer live the same way. Even create the same way she used to. Which was a source of contention in her walk of faith for a long time.
                Through the Grace of God, today she has been able to fully surrender not only her life but her music to Christ and has been making Faith based content for 2 years. Her mission is to tell the honest truth about her walk with Christ. "You will suffer"
                She expresses that even in embarking on her journey nobody ever told her that her Faith would require great sacrifce and dying to self everyday. She had to read that out of The Word.</p>

                <p class="indent">Zoya expresses she doesnt make pain music. Or music full of what conventional suffering may look to others. But she fills her songs with self reflection in regards to her circumstances, She fills her songs with Hope.
                She wants others to know her relationship with herself and her gift is a result of learning the continous lesson of what true worship is.
                Regarding God in all things, and edify people in those things back to the Father. She prays her music installs cofidence in others who feel their gift and who they are doesnt fit. That we are all fearfully and wonderfully made. And it is our gifts
                that open the doors to oppertunity, and will put any and all in the presents and eyes of Kings, queens, rulers, leaders of every kind.</p3>
