    <h2>The Personal Impact</h2>
    <p class="indent">These people really propelled not only my love of music but also my growth as an individual.
         Micah's passionate expressions about music always lit me on fire and his openess to teach and believe in me built my musical confidence. 
         He would throw a task in my hand and remind me how important it was to advocate for myself and ask good question but never be afraid to figure it out. 
         YouTube University was the 3rd person in our working relationship. Whether it was building a studio, or creating like studio chemists, we was gonna figure it out!

        <p class="indent">Fansy was and answered prayer when I was floating around in the music scene looking for others like me. Our working relationship was first a friendship sprinkled with laughs and faith based conversations. 
        When I learned she sang and rapped I knew I had to have her in the studio! 
        Let her tell it I kidnapped her for the evening and some how she'd freed herself with a song about spiritual freedom, but I believed I found the creative God fearing artist I prayed for. 
        She has never ceased to pour into my life and songs with her much need perspective and familiar type resonance.
