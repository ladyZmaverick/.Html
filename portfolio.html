            <b>Collaborators</b>
            <h2>Fansy V.</h2> 
            <img src ="IMAGES\vontipic.jpg"  width="30%"> <p>Fansy is a woman of passion. She's newer to the music scene, but has been an active and exressive writer for many years.
                Her musical mission is to connect with others who may not know that their experiances are similar. She embarked on this musical journey to heal herself and edify others. It's truly a blessing to have her
                in the studio. Shes a creative communicator and provides much needed presents on any project.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Micah Jones</h2>
            <img src = "IMAGES\micahpic.jpg" width="30%"><p>It does matter where Micah goes he will find away to teach music and resonance to others.
                Micah's mission as an artist is to help others understand expression is art. That it's hard but it doesn't have to be. He wants others to see that if you understand things objectivly it will promote subjective creativity.
            Studio sessions with him are full of him bringing out your musical potential and crash courses on sound.</p>
